## About these notes

The files in this Course Notes directory are the pdfs that were used in the lesson videos in the Julia YouTube channel (needs link).

They are organised in a course four weeks long. See the subdirectories Week 1, Week 2, etc.

There is one preliminary lesson, namely Lesson 0, which is in this subdirectory, the only pdf here, namely `BeforeYouStartThisCourse.pdf`. As this lesson to help you decide whether to do the course, it can be skipped provided two conditions are met:
1. you are computer literate enough to write and save plain text files, to start up the Julia program, and to move files around in a directory tree; and
2. you know you do want to start doing the course.

Unfortunately, the exercises that should accompany the lectures do not (yet) exist.
