# Julia Programming for Nervous Beginners

We hope this course will eventually be a good place for people who are very hestitant to start learning how to program.

Why Julia?

Mainly because we love it, but also because it seems to us very well suited to a very slow exposition. On this course, we want to be as explicit as possible (hence the slogan "Nothing Left Out") and also as reasonable as possible ("Everything Makes Sense").

For now, the course consists of two sources: the video material on YouTube (link to follow) and the lesson documents (in PDF format) uploaded here (link to follow)
