# Julia Programming for Nervous Beginners

A course for people who have never programmed, and who are unsure whether they are suited to programming.

We are guided by the following slogans:

#### Small Steps
#### Nothing Left Out
#### Everything Makes Sense

Why Julia?

Mainly because we love it, but also because it seems to us very well suited to a very slow exposition. On this course, we want to be as explicit as possible (hence the slogan "Nothing Left Out") and also as reasonable as possible ("Everything Makes Sense"). Julia allows one to write code that is easily understood but also powerful (in the sense of very few lines of code per useful outcome) but it also allows one to write code that is very detailed (that is, one isn't forced to use high-level functions that cannot be inspected). This makes it easy to give simple examples -- note that our examples are primarily text rather than arithmetic -- while at times delving into details.

Of course, this ability to combine powerful and compact code with high levels of detailed programming is one of the reasons why Julia can be used for development as well as production. Put another way, it can be used for rapid prototyping and then deployed in very large projects with little or no change to the code. (Perhaps even more important is the high frequency of code re-use all over Julia, even across apparently unrelated projects, but that is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this course.

For now, the course consists of two sources: the video material on YouTube (link to follow) and the lesson documents (in PDF format) uploaded here (link to follow)
